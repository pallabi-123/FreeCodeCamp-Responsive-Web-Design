Step 45
Before you start diving in to the table itself, your span elements are currently bolded. Create a span:not(.sr-only) selector and give it a font-weight property set to normal.

The :not() pseudo-selector is used to target all elements that do not match the selector - in this case, any of your span elements that do not have the span[class~="sr-only"] class. This ensures that your earlier rules for the sr-only class are not overwritten.
