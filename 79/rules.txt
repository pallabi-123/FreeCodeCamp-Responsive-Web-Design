Step 79
In the last project, you learned a little bit about borders and the border-color property.

All HTML elements have borders, though they're usually set to none by default. With CSS, you can control all aspects of an element's border, and set the border on all sides, or just one side at a time. For a border to be visible, you need to set its width and style.

In the .sleeve CSS rule, add the border-left-width property with the value 10px.
