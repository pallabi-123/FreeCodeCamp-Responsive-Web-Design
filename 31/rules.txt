The CSS clip property is used to define the visible portions of an element. Set the span[class~="sr-only"] selector to have a clip property of rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px).

The clip-path property determines the shape the clip property should take. Use both the clip-path and -webkit-clip-path selectors to set the value to inset(50%), forming the clip-path into a rectangle within the element.
