Step 16
Every region role requires a visible label, which should be referenced by the aria-labelledby attribute.

To the section elements, give the following aria-labelledby attributes:

student-info
html-questions
css-questions
Then, within each section element, nest one h2 element with an id matching the corresponding aria-labelledby attribute. Give each h2 suitable text content.
