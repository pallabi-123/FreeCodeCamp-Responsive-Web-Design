To make the mountain look more like a mountain, you can use the skew transform function, which takes two arguments. The first being an angle to shear the x-axis by, and the second being an angle to shear the y-axis by.

Use the transform property to skew the mountain by 0deg in the x-axis and 44deg in the y-axis.
