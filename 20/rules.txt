With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid.

Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}

The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out.
