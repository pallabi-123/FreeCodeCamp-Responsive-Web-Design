Step 57
Add another checkbox after the one you just added. The id attribute value should be lazy and the name attribute value should be the same as the last checkbox.

Also add a label element to the right of the new checkbox with the text Lazy. Make sure to associate the label element with the new checkbox using the for attribute.
