Step 46
You can specify where you want a gradient transition to complete by adding it to the color like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2 20%,
  color3
);
Here, it will transition from color1 to color2 between 0% and 20% of the element and then transition to color3 for the rest. Add 80% to the --building-color1 color of the .bb1d gradient so you can see it in action.
