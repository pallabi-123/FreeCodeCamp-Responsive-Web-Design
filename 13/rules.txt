Step 13
You may have noticed that your images have all moved onto the same row.

The flex-wrap property determines how your items should behave when the flex container is too small. Setting this property to wrap will allow your items to wrap to the next row/column (depending on your main axis), where nowrap will prevent your items from wrapping. When this is set to nowrap, items may either shrink to fit or overflow.

Give the #gallery selector a flex-wrap property set to wrap. You should see your images take a four-column layout. This is because you set their width to 25% in an earlier step.
