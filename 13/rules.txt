Your marker would look better if it was centered on the page. An easy way to do that is with the margin shorthand property.

In the last project, you set the margin area of elements separately with properties like margin-top and margin-left. The margin shorthand property makes it easy to set multiple margin areas at the same time.

To center your marker on the page, set its margin property to auto. This sets margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left all to auto.
