Step 78
You can add multiple gradients to an element by separating them with a comma (,) like this:

gradient1(
  colors
),
gradient2(
  colors
);
Add a repeating-linear-gradient to .fb1c below the one that's there; use your --building-color4 from 0% to 10% and --window-color4 from 10% and 90%. This will fill in behind the gradient you added last.
