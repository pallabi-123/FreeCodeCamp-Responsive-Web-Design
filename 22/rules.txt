Step 22
A function is a piece of code that can take an input and perform a specific action. The CSS rgb function accepts values, or arguments, for red, green, and blue, and produces a color:

rgb(red, green, blue);
Each red, green, and blue value is a number from 0 to 255. 0 means that there's 0% of that color, and is black. 255 means that there's 100% of that color.

In the .one CSS rule, replace the color keyword red with the rgb function. For the rgb function, set the value for red to 255, the value for green to 0, and the value for blue to 0.
