Step 28
Add another label after the first, with the text Input your age (years): . Then, nest an input with the type of number.

As we do not want users under the age of 13 to register, add a min attribute to the input with a value of 13. Also, we can probably assume users over the age of 120 will not register; add a max attribute with a value of 120.

Now, if someone tries to submit the form with values outside of the range, a warning will appear, and the form will not submit. Give it a try.
