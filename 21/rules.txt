Step 21
The animation-iteration-count property sets how many times your animation should repeat. This can be set to a number, or to infinite to indefinitely repeat the animation. Your Ferris wheel should never stop, so set the .wheel selector to have an animation-iteration-count of infinite.

The animation-timing-function property sets how the animation should progress over time. There are a few different values for this property, but you want the Ferris wheel animation to run at the same rate from start to finish. Set the animation-timing-function to linear in your .wheel selector.
