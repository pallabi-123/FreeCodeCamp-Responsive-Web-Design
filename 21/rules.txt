I don't like how spaced out the buildings are. Squeeze them together by adding two empty div elements to the top of the background-buildings element, two more at the bottom of it, and one more in between .bb3 and .bb4. These will be added as evenly-spaced elements across the container, effectively moving the buildings closer to the center.
