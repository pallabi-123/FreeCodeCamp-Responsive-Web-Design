Inform with the Paragraph Element:

p elements are the preferred element for paragraph text on websites. p is short for "paragraph".

You can create a paragraph element like this:

<p>I'm a p tag!</p>
Create a p element below your h2 element, and give it the text Hello Paragraph.

Note: As a convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase, for example <p></p> and not <P></P>.



<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
