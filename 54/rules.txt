Step 54
Add these properties to .bb2a:

margin: auto;
width: 5vw;
height: 5vw;
border-top: 1vw solid #000;
border-bottom: 1vw solid #000;
border-left: 1vw solid #999;
border-right: 1vw solid #999;
After you add these, you can see how a thick border on an element gives you some angles where two sides meet. You are going to use that bottom border as the top of the building.
