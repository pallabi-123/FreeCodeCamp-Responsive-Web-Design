Step 6
In the previous step, you nested the h2 element, comment, and p element within the main element. A nested element is a child of its parent element. It should be indented two more spaces than its parent element to improve readability, like this:

<ul> 
  <li> Child Element 1 </li>
  <li> Child Element 2 </li>
</ul>
Add two spaces in front of the three child elements of main so your HTML is more readable.
