Step 33
I see some code that can be optimized. Move the position and top properties and values from .foreground-buildings to .background-buildings. Then select both .background-buildings and .foreground-buildings there, effectively applying those styles to both of the elements. You can use a comma (,) to separate selectors like this: selector1, selector2.
