          <p>
            JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted
            compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting
            language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web
            pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be
            used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side
            developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of
            language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like
            Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like
            operators, control structures, and statements.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Client-side:</strong> It supplies objects to control a
              browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side
              extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form
              and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and
              page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are
              AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Server-side:</strong> It supplies objects relevant to
              running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions
              allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide
              continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
              application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful
              framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Imperative language:</strong> In this type of language we
              are mostly concern about how it is to be done . It simply control
              the flow of computation . The procedural programming approach ,
              object, oriented approach comes under this like async await we are
              thinking what it is to be done further after async call.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declarative programming:</strong> In this type of language
              we are concern about how it is to be done , basically here logical
              computation require . Here main goal is to describe the desired
              result without direct dictation on how to get it like arrow
              function do .
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Internal JS:</strong> We can add JavaScript directly to
              our HTML file by writing the code inside the
              <b
                ><u><mark>script</mark></u></b
              >
              tag. The
              <b
                ><u><mark>script</mark></u></b
              >
              tag can either be placed inside the
              <b
                ><u><mark>head</mark></u></b
              >
              or the
              <b
                ><u><mark>body</mark></u></b
              >
              tag according to the requirement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>External JS:</strong> We can write JavaScript code in
              other file having an extension.js and then link this file inside
              the
              <b
                ><u><mark>head</mark></u></b
              >
              tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>History of Javascript:</h3>
          <p>
            It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at
            Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was
            renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language
            has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a
            scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host
            environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside
            world. The most common host environment is the browser.
          </p>

          <h3>Features of JavaScript:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation.
              Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic
              Web sites were made.
            </li>
            <li>
              Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods
              just like another object. They can be passed as arguments in other
              functions.
            </li>
            <li>Can handle date and time.</li>
            <li>
              Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using
              HTML.
            </li>
            <li>No compiler is needed.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Applications of JavaScript:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Web Development:</strong> Adding interactivity and
              behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented to do this in
              1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web Applications:</strong> With technology, browsers have
              improved to the extent that a language was required to create
              robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then
              we only need to click and drag the mouse. All detailed view is
              just a click away, and this is possible only because of
              JavaScript. It uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that
              provide extra power to the code. The Electron and React is helpful
              in this department.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Server Applications:</strong> With the help of Node.js,
              JavaScript made its way from client to server and node.js is the
              most powerful on the server-side.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Games: </strong>Not only in websites, but JavaScript also
              helps in creating games for leisure. The combination of JavaScript
              and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well.
              It provides the EaseJS library which provides solutions for
              working with rich graphics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Smartwatches:</strong>JavaScript is being used in all
              possible devices and applications. It provides a library PebbleJS
              which is used in smartwatch applications. This framework works for
              applications that require the internet for its functioning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Art:</strong>Artists and designers can create whatever
              they want using JavaScript to draw on HTML 5 canvas, and make the
              sound more effective also can be used p5.js library.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Machine Learning:</strong>This JavaScript ml5.js library
              can be used in web development by using machine learning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile Applications:</strong>JavaScript can also be used
              to build an application for non-web contexts. The features and
              uses of JavaScript make it a powerful tool for creating mobile
              applications. This is a Framework for building web and mobile apps
              using JavaScript. Using React Native, we can build mobile
              applications for different operating systems. We do not require to
              write code for different systems. Write once use it anywhere!
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Limitations of JavaScript:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Security risks:</strong>JavaScript can be used to fetch
              data using AJAX or by manipulating tags that load data such as
              <b
                ><u><mark>img</mark></u></b
              >,
              <b
                ><u><mark>object</mark></u></b
              >,<b
                ><u><mark>script</mark></u></b
              >
              . These attacks are called cross site script attacks. They inject
              JS that is not the part of the site into the visitor’s browser
              thus fetching the details.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance: </strong> JavaScript does not provide the
              same level of performance as offered by many traditional languages
              as a complex program written in JavaScript would be comparatively
              slow. But as JavaScript is used to perform simple tasks in a
              browser, so performance is not considered a big restriction in its
              use.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Complexity:</strong>To master a scripting language,
              programmers must have a thorough knowledge of all the programming
              concepts, core language objects, client and server-side objects
              otherwise it would be difficult for them to write advanced scripts
              using JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weak error handling and type checking facilities: </strong
              >It is weakly typed language as there is no need to specify the
              data type of the variable. So wrong type checking is not performed
              by compile.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            Why JavaScript is known as a lightweight programming language?
          </h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript is considered as lightweight due to the fact that it has
            low CPU usage, is easy to implement and has a minimalist syntax.
            Minimalist syntax as in, it has no data types. Everything is treated
            here as an object. It is very easy to learn because of its syntax
            similar to C++ and Java.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lightweight language does not consume much of your CPU’s
            resources. It doesn’t put excess strain on your CPU or RAM.
            JavaScript runs in the browser even though it has complex paradigms
            and logic which means it uses fewer resources than other languages.
            For example, NodeJs, a variation of JavaScript not only performs
            faster computations but also uses less resources than its
            counterparts such as Dart or Java.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, when compared with other programming languages, it has
            less in-built libraries or frameworks, contributing as another
            reason for it to be lightweight. However, this brings it a drawback
            that we need to incorporate external libraries and frameworks.
          </p>

          <h3>Is JavaScript compiled or interpreted or both?</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript is both compiled and interpreted. In the earlier versions
            of JavaScript, it used only the interpreter that executed code line
            by line and shows the result immediately. But with time the
            performance became an issue as interpretation is quite slow.
            Therefore, in the newer versions of JS, probably after the V8, JIT
            compiler was also incorporated to optimize the execution and display
            the result more quickly. This JIT compiler generates a bytecode that
            is relatively easier to code. This bytecode is a set of highly
            optimized instructions. The V8 engine initially uses an interpreter,
            to interpret the code. On further executions, the V8 engine finds
            patterns such as frequently executed functions, frequently used
            variables, and compiles them to improve performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is best known for web page development but it is also
            used in a variety of non-browser environments.

            JS stands for JavaScript. It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and
            interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development
            of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript
            can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side
            developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects,

          <h3>Characteristics of JS:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>independent:</strong> JavaScript runs on browsers which is
              available on all kinds of machines and is hence platform
              independent.
            </li>
            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dynamically typed languages:</strong> This language can
              receive different data types over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Case Sensitive Format:</strong> JavaScript is case
              sensitive so you have to be aware of that.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Light Weight: </strong> It is so lightweight, and all the
              browsers are supported by JS.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Handling: </strong> Handling events is the main feature of
              JS, it can easily respond on the website when the user tries to
              perform any operation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interpreter Centered: </strong> JavaScript is built with
              interpreter centered that allows the user to get the output
              without the use of the compiler.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Advantages of JS:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              JavaScript is executed on the user’s browsers not on the webserver
              so it saves bandwidth and load on the webserver.
            </li>
            <li>
              The JavaScript language is easy to learn it offers syntax that is
              close to English language.
            </li>
            <li>
              In JavaScript, if you ever need any certain feature then you can
              write it by yourself and use an add-on like Greasemonkey to
              implement it on the web page.
            </li>
            <li>
              It does not require a compilation process so no compiler is needed
              user’s browsers do the task.
            </li>
            <li>
              JavaScript is easy to debug, and there are lots of frameworks
              available that you can use and become master on that.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is constantly being improved and newer features are being
              introduced that significantly tamp down the lines of code for web
              applications. For example, Arrow Functions were introduced in the
              ES6 version which provides a short syntax to write anonymous
              functions.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Disadvantages of JS:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              JavaScript codes are visible to the user so user can place some
              code into the site that compromises the security of data over the
              website. That will be security issue.

              JavaScript stores numbers as 64-bit floating-point numbers but
              operators operate on 32-bit bitwise operands. JavaScript first
              converts the number to 32 bit, performs the operation, and
              converts it to 64 bit again which reduces its speed.

        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
          "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
          (lowercase).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <article>
          You can declare a variable in three ways:
          <p>
            With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            By simply assigning it a value. For example,
            <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
            generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
            variant.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
            Variable scope below.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
            scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
            function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
            example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
            function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
            block, which in this case is an if statement.
          </p>
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
          <p>
            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
            ECMAScript 2015.
          </p>

          <code
            >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
            not defined</code
          >
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
        <header>Global variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
            pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
            variables using the window.variable syntax.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
            or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
            frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
            declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
            iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
            identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
            and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
          </p>

          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>
            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
            while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
          </p>

          <p>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
            scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
            assumed to represent a variable.
          </p>

          <p>
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
            variable in the same scope. For example:
          </p>

          <code
            >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
            //statements }</code
          >
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
          statement is executed without problems.
          <code
            >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
            "otherValue";</code

        <header>Data types</header>
        <article>
          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>
                  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                  JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                  NULL, or any other variant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                </li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>
                  Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                  are unique and immutable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>and Object</li>
          </ul>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
          you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
          procedures that your application can perform.

      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <article>
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

          <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
          statement, including further nested if statements.
          <p>
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
          </p>
          <code
            >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
            statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
            statement_last; }
          </code>
          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
          which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
          statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
          general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
          when nesting if statements:

          <code
            >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
          >
          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
          expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
          glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
          <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
          an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
          additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

          <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <article>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

          <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
          false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
          the statement following the loop.

          <p>
            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
            If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
            condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
            stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
          </p>

          <p>
            To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
            group those statements.
          </p>

          Example:

          <p>
            The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
          </p>

          <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
          <p>
            With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
            Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
            <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
            <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
            true, so the loop terminates.

        <article>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
              separated by commas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in

            The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
            consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
            function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
            statement specifies the value returned by the function.
          </p>
          <code>return number * number;</code>
          <p>
            Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
            value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
            changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
            globally or in the calling function.
