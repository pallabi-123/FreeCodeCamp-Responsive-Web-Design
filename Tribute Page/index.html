      <p>London-born <strong> Ada Lovelace </strong> (1815–1852) had a passion and gift for mathematics from a young age. She is credited with being <strong>the world's first computer programmer,</strong> as she drafted plans for how a machine called the Analytical Engine could perform computations. The machine, invented by her friend, mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage, is considered to be the first general computer. Lovelace detailed applications for the Analytical Engine that relate to how computers are used today.

Lovelace is remembered annually on Ada Lovelace Day, held on the second Tuesday of October. The international day of recognition celebrates women in science, technology, engineering, and math <b>(STEM)</b>.
