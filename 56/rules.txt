Step 56
The key difference between tr[class="total"] and tr.total is that the first will select tr elements where the only class is total. The second will select tr elements where the class includes total.

In your case, tr.total will work. You can use this selector to target all td elements within your .total rows. Align the text to the right, and give them a padding of 0 0.25rem.
