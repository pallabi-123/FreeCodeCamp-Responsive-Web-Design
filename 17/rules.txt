Step 17
You now need to define how your animation should start. To do this, create a 0% rule within your @keyframes wheel rule. The properties you set in this nested selector will apply at the beginning of your animation.

As an example, this would be a 12% rule:

@keyframes freecodecamp {
  12% {
    color: green;
  }
}
