Typeface plays an important role in the accessibility of a page. Some fonts are easier to read than others, and this is especially true on low-resolution screens.

Change the font for both the h1 and h2 elements to Verdana, and use another web-safe font in the sans-serif family as a fallback.

Also, add a border-bottom of 4px solid #dfdfe2 to h2 elements to make the sections distinct.
