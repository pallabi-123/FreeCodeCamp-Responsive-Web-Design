Step 44
Gradients can use as many colors as you want like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2,
  color3
);
Add a linear-gradient to .bb1d with orange as the first color, --building-color1 as the second, and --window-color1 as the third. Remember to use the gradient on the background property.
