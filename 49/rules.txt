Step 49
You've learned a few ways to set flat colors in CSS, but you can also use a color transition, or gradient, on an element.

A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.

In the .red CSS rule, change the background-color property to background.
