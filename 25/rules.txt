Step 25
The .sr-only text is still visible. There is a common pattern to visually hide text for only screen readers to read.

This pattern is to set the following CSS properties:

position: absolute;
width: 1px;
height: 1px;
padding: 0;
margin: -1px;
overflow: hidden;
clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
white-space: nowrap;
border: 0;
Use the above to define the sr-only class.
