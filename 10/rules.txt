Step 10
Now that you have reset the html box model, you need to pass that on to the elements within as well. To do this, you can set the box-sizing property to inherit, which will tell the targeted elements to use the same value as the parent element.

You will also need to target the pseudo-elements, which are special keywords that follow a selector. The two pseudo-elements you will be using are the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements.

The ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is the first child of the selected element, while the ::after selector creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of the selected element. These pseudo-elements are often used to create cosmetic content, which you will see later in this project.

For now, create a CSS selector to target all elements with *, and include the pseudo-elements with ::before and ::after. Set the box-sizing property to inherit.
