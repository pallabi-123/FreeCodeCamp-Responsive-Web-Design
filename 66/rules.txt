The @media at-rule has a media feature called prefers-reduced-motion to set CSS based on the user's preferences. It can take one of the following values:

no-preference
@media (feature: value) {
  selector {
    styles
  }
}
Wrap the style rule that sets scroll-behavior: smooth within an @media at-rule with the media feature prefers-reduced-motion having no-preference set as the value.
