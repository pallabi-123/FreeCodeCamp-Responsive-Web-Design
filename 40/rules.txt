Step 40
Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element. They are applied to the background property and the syntax looks like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2
);
In the example, color1 is solid at the top, color2 is solid at the bottom, and in between it transitions evenly from one to the next. In .bb1a, add a gradient of type linear-gradient to the background property with --building-color1 as the first color and --window-color1 as the second.
