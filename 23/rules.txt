Hmm, I'm not sure why that didn't work. You can add a fallback value to a variable by putting it as the second value of where you use the variable like this: var(--variable-name, fallback-value). The property will use the fallback value when there's a problem with the variable. Add a fallback value of green to the background-color of .bb2.
