Step 47
You may already be familiar with decimal, or base 10 values, which go from 0 - 9. Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).

Lower the intensity of green by setting green value of the hex color to 7F.
