Step 15
To use a variable, put the variable name in parentheses with var in front of them like this: var(--variable-name). Add your variable as the value of the background-color property of the .bb1a class. Whatever value you gave the variable will be applied to whatever property you use it on. In this case, your variable has the value of #999. So #999 will be used as the value for the background-color property.
