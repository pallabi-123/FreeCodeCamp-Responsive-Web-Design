Step 37
Time to use some FontAwesome icons.

The i element is used for idiomatic text, or text that is separate from the "normal" text content. This could be for italic text, such as scientific terms, or for icons like those provided by FontAwesome.

Within your white-paper element, add four i elements. Give them all a class value of fas fa-music.

This special class is how FontAwesome determines which icon to load. fas indicates the category of icons (FontAwesome Solid, here), while fa-music selects the specific icon.
